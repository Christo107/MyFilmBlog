# My Film blog
This website was designed and developed as a film review blog where reviews of the latest films could be posted, with site users able to read the reviews, and registered site users able to comment and click like on the reviews. This allows users to engage with other users in a conversation on the films being reviewed.

The website has a simple layout with a homepage containing a list of the latest reviews, along with an actors biography section.

#### Chrome Developer tools
- A variety of screen sizes were checked for responsiveness using the Developer tools from 4K displays at 2560px wide, laptop sizes 1440px and 1024px, tablets at 768px, and a variety of mobile sizes down to 320px width. All elements maintained functionality and visibility in all scenarios, however, there were some issues with responsiveness on images on the actor_detail page on smaller devices.
- A Lighthouse report was run several times to gauge the performance, accessibility, best practice and SEO scores.
